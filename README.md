#Using git with Github

##Creating repo-
use `git clone` (cloning someone else's)

use `git init` (making your own rep)

##Staging files in repo-
use `git add [filename]` to add edited files

use `git rm [filename]` to remove files that were accidentally added.

##Committing stage files
use ` git commit -m "YOUR SUMMARIZATION MESSAGE HERE"`

NEVER COMMIT CODE THAT DOESNT WORK

##Pulling and Pushing

use `git pull origin < branch name >` in order to download latest code

ALWAYS PULL BEFORE YOU PUSH to avoid mistakes

use `git push origin < branch name >` to push you edited code to Github

Origin is remote name that may have alt. name
